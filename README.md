## Additional

- This was my **first time** working with VueJs + NuxtJs. I have experience of 1+ years with ReactJs + NextJs.
- The UI is not responsive. So, it might look different on other screen sizes. If you face any difficulty, please have a look using responsive Dev Tools using this recommended width, `1536px`

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
